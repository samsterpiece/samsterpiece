I'm a software engineer that is eager to learn and understand new concepts and ideas through collaborating with others, project development, all while building a community with fellow people in Tech, building a support network for those navigating through the tech industry and let my journey be a story of inspiration and motivation for others who have been feeling lost during their journey. Some technologies I enjoy working with are currently Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript with a goal of becoming proficient with React and Vue.JS.
